# ### Arithmetic Expressions
# 
# Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[4]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print("Result:", result)


# In[5]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print("Hours:", hours)
